mod_proxyerrorcapture
=====================

This module is an alternative to ``ProxyErrorOverride On`` which either
overrides all errors or not and most of the time that is not what you want.

Install from source
-------------------

Fairly standard make::

    make proxyerrorcapture
    sudo make install


Install from deb
----------------

Download from github and install with dpkg::

    wget https://github.com/downloads/isotoma/libapache2-mod-proxyerrorcapture/libapache2-mod-proxyerrorcapture_0.0.0_amd64.deb
    sudo dpkg -i libapache2-mod-proxyerrorcapture_0.0.0_amd64.deb


Configuring
-----------

Enable it::

    sudo a2enmod proxyerrorcapture


And turn it on in your vhosts::

    ProxyErrorCapture 503 On
    ProxyErrorCapture 500 On
    ProxyErrorCapture 404 Off


Now 500 and 503 errors will be served emergency pages from Apache, but 404's
will still come from the proxied backend. Note that the default is ``off``.

Any ErrorDocument stanzas will be respected. He claims, not having actually
tested that bit. 

TODO
----

 * Is this per vhost? It should be really...
 * Needs a beating / load test.
